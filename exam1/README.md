# UChicago CS Placement Exam #1 - Practice Problems

This directory contains the files needed to work on eight practice
problems for the first Computer Science Placement Exam at the
University of Chicago.

There are three subdirectories, one for each the supported languages
in the exam:

- `cpp/`: C++ files
- `java/`: Java files
- `python3/`: Python files

Each of the above directories contains, in turn, the following:

- `problem_statements/`: PDFs of the problem statements
- `src/`: Skeleton code for the problems (which you must complete
  to solve each problem), as well as testing code so you can test
  your solutions. This directory contains a language-specific
  `README.md` explaining how to run and test your solutions to
  the problems.
- `test-data/`: Testing data used by our testing code.
