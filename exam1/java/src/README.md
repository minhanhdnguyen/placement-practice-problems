This directory contains the skeleton code for working on the practice problems.
To solve the problems, you must only edit the following files.

- **Problem 1**: `problem1.java`  
- **Problem 2**: `problem2.java`  
- **Problem 3**: `problem3.java`  
- **Problem 4**: `problem4.java`
- **Problem 5**: `restaurant.java`
- **Problem 6**: `committee.java`
- **Problem 7**: `problem7.java`  
- **Problem 8**: `problem8.java`  

You will find additional files in this directory. **Do not** edit those files (they
are auxiliary files needed to run and test your code).

For each problem, we have provided a testing program that checks your
solution against some test data.  To compile the test program, run:

    javac <Test file>

For example, to compile the test code for problem 1, run:

    javac Test1.java

The command-line interface is the same for all the test programs. For
example, to run the (compiled) test code for problem 1, on a single
test file, run:

    java Test1 -t <path to test file>

e.g.

    java Test1 -t ../test-data/problem1/001.in

To run all the tests for problem 1, run:

    java Test1 -a ../test-data/problem1
