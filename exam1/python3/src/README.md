This directory contains the skeleton code for working on the practice problems.
To solve the problems, you must only edit the following files.

- **Problem 1**: `problem1.py`  
- **Problem 2**: `problem2.py`  
- **Problem 3**: `problem3.py`  
- **Problem 4**: `problem4.py`
- **Problem 5**: `restaurant.py`
- **Problem 6**: `committee.py`
- **Problem 7**: `problem7.py`  
- **Problem 8**: `problem8.py`  

You will find additional files in this directory. **Do not** edit those files (they
are auxiliary files needed to run and test your code).

For each problem, we have provided a testing program
that checks your solution against some test data.  The command-line interface is
the same for all the test scripts. For example, to run the test code
for problem 1, on a single test file, run:

    python3 test1.py -t <path to test file>

e.g.

    python3 test1.py -t ../test-data/problem1/001.in

To run all the tests for problem 1, run:

    python3 test1.py -a ../test-data/problem1
