This directory contains the starter code for working on the practice problems.
To solve the problems, you must only edit the following files.

- **Problem 1**: `coop.py`
- **Problem 2**: `same_color.py`
- **Problem 3**: `anothertricky.py` (note: no starter code is included in this file; you must implement everything from scratch in this problem)

You will find additional files in this directory. **Do not** edit those files (they
are auxiliary files needed to run and test your code).

For Problems 1 and 2, we have provided testing programs
that checks your solution against some test data. The command-line interface is
the same for all the test scripts. For example, to run the problem 1 test code
on a single test file, run:

    python3 coop_test.py -t <path to test file>

e.g.

    python3 coop_test.py -t ../../test-data/1-coop/coop-001.in

To run all the tests for problem 1, run:

    python3 coop_test.py -a ../../test-data/1-coop/

For Problem 3, we have not provided any testing programs.
You are responsible for reading in
the test data from a file, and printing the correct output.
Please see the problem statement for more details.
